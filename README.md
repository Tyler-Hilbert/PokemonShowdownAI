# PokemonShowdownAI
This is 2 projects I wrote while making a bot that is capable of playing the online player vs player game Pokemon Showdown.
## RandomSetGenerationAnalysis
This is an attempt to analyze the different sets that can be randomly generated. This will be useful information in situations where the opponent has unknown pokemon,moves,abilities, etc.
## SelectLead
This is a bot that is capable of making the first move in a game. This works for game modes that have all pokemon revealed at the beginning of the game. It currently tries to optimize the ratio of strengths to weaknesses for the first turn. It will be converted to look multiple turns ahead using a minimax algorithm.
